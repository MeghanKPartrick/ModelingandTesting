<h1>Modeling and Testing</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, a comprehensive dataset of used cars in the US is utilized. I dive deeper into analyzing Prices on the Ford Focus SE in North Carolina and Georgia using Year and Milage as predictors. Various models and transformations are employed to determine the most effective ones, with additional testing and intervals produced on coefficients of the models.
